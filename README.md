> # Known Issues  
> - Need to tighten up error checking on parsing selectors
> - Selector chaining not implemented
> - Output shows paths only.  Perhaps display content in *label* nodes if it exists, and show path otherwise? 

> # Follow-up Questions  
> ### Performance
> - Is full tree search acceptable?
